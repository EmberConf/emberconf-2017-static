        <p>In this training we'll go over the basics of acceptance testing your Ember applications. If you've never written an acceptance test, or have only written a few but find yourself or your team struggling to write them consistently, this training is for you.</p>
        <p>The key to incorporating testing into your development workflow is to write tests that have a net benefit. Once your developers and product managers see the value of your test suite, your team will never go back.</p>
        <p>The benefit of a test is its value minus its cost. Thus, we'll spend time discussing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The value of acceptance tests vs. other tests in an Ember application</li>
            <li>How to lower the cost of writing acceptance tests</li>
            <li>The importance of understanding a test's level of abstraction</li>
          </ul>
        <p>As a class, we will also develop the practical skills needed to be successful writing tests, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to write test helpers for custom UI components like drag-and-drop widgets</li>
            <li>A discussion of Ember's run loop and its importance in testing</li>
            <li>How to use addons like Ember CLI Mirage and Ember CLI Page Object to enforce testing conventions across your team, and more.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Ember's testing story is stronger than ever, and really sets it apart from other frontend frameworks. Use this training as an opportunity to get your team excited and up to speed about testing in Ember.</p>

      description: |
        <p>You've surely heard of OAuth 2.0 before, but did you know that the protocol has of four distinct flows? Each of these flows supports an explicit deployment scenario, and misusing these flows will likely cause your application to be vulnerable to various attacks.</p>
        <p>In this workshop, attendees will learn how to correctly implement OAuth 2.0 into Ember applications using <code>ember-simple-auth</code> and Torii. On top of that, we will go over the most common security issues in OAuth 2.0 implementations, and how you can mitigate them in your application.</p>
        <p>At the end of the workshop, attendees will understand what OAuth 2.0 is all about, and how they can integrate it using the Torii library. They’ll have a clear view on which OAuth 2.0 strategy (flow) to choose depending on the use case. On top of that, they will understand common security issues in OAuth 2.0 implementations, and how to effectively mitigate them.</p>
        <p>During the hands-on exercises, attendees will implement OAuth 2.0 support in a realistic training application. The exercises will be fully documented, and attendees will be able to use the provided application as a reference after the workshop.</p>

      description:  |
        <p>Join us in this intermediate training to learn several new component patterns you can bring back to your apps. We'll start by going over some foundations like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The importance of component conventions for your team</li>
            <li>How to think about a component's public and private interface</li>
            <li>The different component lifecycles and when to use them</li>
          </ul>
        <p>We'll also work through many examples together. Through these examples you'll learn:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mistakes that limit the composability of your components</li>
            <li>How to use Ember Concurrency to write maintainable data-loading components</li>
            <li>When to use data down actions up-and when to avoid it</li>
            <li>The tradeoff between 'smart' and 'dumb' components</li><li>Some patterns for component-based styling and more.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Components are the building blocks of modern Ember applications, so small knowledge gains in this area can have a huge impact on your team's effectiveness. You'll leave this training with new perspectives and a deeper understanding of this crucial piece of Ember development.</p>
